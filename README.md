# EmailApplication
One of my part time projects to better my skills.

This is a program which would be used by enterprises to generate email addresses for itâ€™s employees. 
Company mail and employee name is fixed currently but in this project I wanted to focus on the process of generating a random password. I also focused on automating the process of creating user profile in certain departments of the company.

Code is written using java and is run in console.

## Example:

In this case I chose the second department and the app worked around that information. It created an email address for Jan who works in the development department. It created a random password for him and added default mailbox capacity.
